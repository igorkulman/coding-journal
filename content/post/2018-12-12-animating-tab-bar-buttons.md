If you use the Twitter app on iOS you might have noticed that tapping the buttons in the tab bar makes them bounces.

This is a very subtle animation that I really like so I decided to do the same for the tab bar in the app I currently work on. 

The first step is to find the right place to insert the bounce animation into. When you tap a button in the tab bar, the `tabBar(_ tabBar: UITabBar, didSelect item: UITabBarItem)` method of the `UITabBarController` gets called. You cannot override this method in extension, so you have to create a new subclass. 

This method gives you the selected `UITabBarItem` but you need to get to the actual view and its image. I found out that the tab bar contains (at least in my case) a background subview and then subviews corresponding to the tab bar buttons, so when a tab bar button at index N is tapped, its subview is at N+1.

class AnimatedTabBarController: UITabBarController {

    override func tabBar(_ tabBar: UITabBar, didSelect item: UITabBarItem) {
        // find index if the selected tab bar item, then find the corresponding view and get its image, the view position is offset by 1 because the first item is the background (at least in this case)
        guard let idx = tabBar.items?.index(of: item), tabBar.subviews.count > idx + 1, let imageView = tabBar.subviews[idx + 1].subviews.flatMap { $0 as? UIImageView }.first else {
            return
        }

        // animate the imageView
    }
}

To create a bounce animation we can use `CAKeyframeAnimation` and animate the `transform.scale` key path. Basically, you need to make the image bigger, then slightly smaller and original size again. This is the animation I use

{{< highlight swift >}}
let bounceAnimation = CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "transform.scale")
bounceAnimation.values = [1.0, 1.4, 0.9, 1.02, 1.0]
bounceAnimation.duration = TimeInterval(0.3)
bounceAnimation.calculationMode = CAAnimationCalculationMode.cubic

It is more visible as the one in the Twitter app, you can tweak the values to get the animation you like best.

The resulting class code looks like this

{{< highlight swift >}}
class AnimatedTabBarController: UITabBarController {

    private var bounceAnimation: CAKeyframeAnimation = {
        let bounceAnimation = CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "transform.scale")
        bounceAnimation.values = [1.0, 1.4, 0.9, 1.02, 1.0]
        bounceAnimation.duration = TimeInterval(0.3)
        bounceAnimation.calculationMode = CAAnimationCalculationMode.cubic
        return bounceAnimation
    }()

    override func tabBar(_ tabBar: UITabBar, didSelect item: UITabBarItem) {
        // find index if the selected tab bar item, then find the corresponding view and get its image, the view position is offset by 1 because the first item is the background (at least in this case)
        guard let idx = tabBar.items?.index(of: item), tabBar.subviews.count > idx + 1, let imageView = tabBar.subviews[idx + 1].subviews.flatMap { $0 as? UIImageView }.first else {
            return
        }

        imageView.layer.add(bounceAnimation, forKey: nil)
    }
}
