If you use the standard iOS `UIAlertController` to present the user with a list of actions, there is not much you can do about styling each of the `UIAlertAction`s shown. 

The text of the shown `UIAlertAction` uses the `UIView`'s tint color, so you can use the `UIAppearence` API to change it to any color you want, but the same color for all the `UIAlertAction`s. If you set the style to `destructive` instead of `default`, the text is shown as red, not affected by the tint color.

`UIAlertController` with one `default` and one `destructive` action might then look like this with dark blue set as the global tint color using `UIAppearence`:

The red color for the destructive option does not look that great, especially if your app uses a different shade of red everywhere else. 

If you dive deep into Apple documentation you will find a KVC called `titleTextColor`. This KVC allows you to set exactly what you need, the color for the `UIAlertAction` text.

You can then use a simple extension

{{< highlight swift >}}
extension UIAlertAction {
    var titleTextColor: UIColor? {
        get {
            return self.value(forKey: "titleTextColor") as? UIColor
        } set {
            self.setValue(newValue, forKey: "titleTextColor")
        }
    }
}
{{< /highlight>}}

to use the correct shade of red for your destructive actions

or to make any of the `UIAlertAction`s to be shown in any color you want or need.
