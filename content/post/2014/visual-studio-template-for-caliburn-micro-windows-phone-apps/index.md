I have been building Windows Phone apps using the [Caliburn.Micro][1] framework for some time now. Setting up a new project takes some time and can be easily automated, so I decided to create a Visual Studio template for Windows Phone apps build with Caliburn.Micro.

The templates can be downloaded from [the Visual Studio Extensions gallery][2] and used to build Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps. It contains the basic setup with Caliburn Micro and [Fody][3], with a sample view and viewmodel.

The [source code is available on GitHub][4], so if you want to modify it to best suit your needs, feel free to do it.
