The have created a series of books for programmes called the [Succinctly series][2]. The goal of the series is to create 50-100 pages ebooks covering various topics. Each book should give you an introduction to the topic inc a succint way, so you do not have to read thick books or spend time finding relevant blog post covering the selected topic. 

All the 20 books covering topics like Data Structures, iOS, Windows Store apps, F#, Git, Gis, HTTP, JQuery, Knockout.js ann many more ale completely free and promise to stay free forever, including all the updates. They are all available in PDF and Kindle format.

I have read two books so far; Git Succinctly and F# Succinctly. They were both well written and I would recommend them to programmers wanting to learn about those technologies.
