In my current project, I have chosen [NancyFx][1] to implement a REST API. NancyFx is a .NET framework known for its &#8220;[super-duper-happy-path][2]&#8220;. 

In one use case I generate a ZIP file in the temp folder and I want the API to return this ZIP file. NancyFx contains a Responses.AsFile helper but it works only with paths relative to the application. 

If you have an absolute path of a file, you cannot use it. You need to create a StreamResponse and return the file as an attachment

{{< highlight csharp >}}
var file = new FileStream(zipPath, FileMode.Open);
string fileName = //set a filename

var response = new StreamResponse(() => file, MimeTypes.GetMimeType(fileName));
                  
return response.AsAttachment(fileName);
{{< / highlight >}}
