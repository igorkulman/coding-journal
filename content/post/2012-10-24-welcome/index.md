I have been playing with the idea of having a coding blog in English for some time now. I have written some posts about programming in C# and Windows Phone 7 on my Slovak web, but I wanted to address a wider audience. I plan to publish one post per week, mainly about WinRT programming. I want the posts to be useful and solve a particular problem I stumble upon in my work developing Windows Store apps.

If you understand Slovak, definetely check my web [www.kulman.sk][1]
