Gamification is a great concept that works really well for some people, including me. Gamification may very well be the reason for success of projects like [StackOveflow][1] or [Duolingo][2].

**Visual Studio Achievements**

[Visual Studio Achievements][3] is Visual Studio plugin that rewards you for good practices like having 1000 localized values ([Localization Master][4]) and even for bad practices like writin a single line of 300 characters long ([Scroll Bar Wizard][5]). For some of the achievements you need to have FxCop installed, but the majority get awareded without the need for it.
