There is no AutoCompleteBox control that can be used when building Windows Store apps in C# and XAML so I decided to create one, because I needed it for a project. Currently it supports only String collections and the selected value must be accessed using code behind, but this will hopefully change. 

The AutoCompleteBox uses [WinRT XAML Toolkit][1] to show the watermark and [Reactive Extensions][2] so the users does not need to press enter, the results will show after they stop typing for a second.

The project is hosted on my Bitbucket so you can check it out at <https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox>, forks and code contributions are welcomed. Nuget package is available at <https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT>.

Installation using Nuget: 

```
Install-Package AutoCompleteBoxWinRT
```
