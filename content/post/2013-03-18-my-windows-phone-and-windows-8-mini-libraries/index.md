I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget.

**Windows Phone**

Code: <https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP7>
  
Nuget: <https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP7/>

**Windows 8**

Code: <https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WinRT>
  
Nuget: <https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WinRT>

My Windows 8 mini-library is best used with the [WinRTXAMLToolkit][1] that I contributed to once ot twice.

**AutoCompleteBox for WinRT**

Code: <https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox>
  
Nuget: <https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT/>
