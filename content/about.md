📱 Doing mobile applications development for over a decade, currently **building iOS applications** after the death of Windows Phone. I helped build privacy focused applications as an **iOS developer** in the ProtonVPN team at [ProtonMail](https://www.protonmail.com) or the industry leading corporate secure messaging application at [Teamwire](https://www.teamwire.eu).

🎓 Obtained my master's degree in **Computer Science** from the Charles University in Prague (the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics) focusing on **Software Engineering**. 

🧑‍💻 This blog mostly covers my **programming experience** venturing into the world of **iOS and Swift** and my previous dealing with **Windows Phone and Windows development**. You can also find some rants here, because I do not like when stuff breaks. 

🖥 Take a look at my  [open-source software](https://github.com/igorkulman) to get a better understanding of my work.

🇸🇰 I also write a [blog in Slovak about non-programming stuff](https://www.kulman.sk), check it out if you are able to read it.

🎤 If you want to know more about the way I work, read my [interview about working from home](https://remotehabits.com/interview/interview-with-igor-kulman-a-software-engineer-building-ios-apps-remotely), check out my [macOS and iOS work setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/igor-kulmans-macos-iphone-and-watch-setup) or listen to a [podcast episode about my experience trying to pitch a proposal for Swift](https://devchat.tv/iphreaks/ips-264-pitching-to-swift-with-igor-kulman/).
