📱 I’ve been developing mobile applications for over a decade, now **focused on iOS development** after the demise of Windows Phone. I contributed to privacy-focused applications as an **iOS developer** in the ProtonVPN team at [ProtonMail](https://www.protonmail.com) and helped build an industry-leading corporate secure messaging application at [Teamwire](https://www.teamwire.eu).  

🎓 I hold a master's degree in **Computer Science** from Charles University in Prague (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics), specializing in **Software Engineering**.  

🧑‍💻 This blog covers my **programming journey**, exploring **iOS and Swift** development alongside my past experiences with **Windows Phone and Windows development**. You’ll also find the occasional rant—because I dislike when things break.  

🖥 Check out my [open-source software](https://github.com/igorkulman) to get a better sense of my work.  

🇸🇰 I also write a [blog in Slovak about non-programming topics](https://www.kulman.sk). If you can read it, feel free to check it out.
