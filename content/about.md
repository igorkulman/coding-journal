👋 Hi, I’m Igor!

📱 I’ve been building mobile apps for over a decade, these days, I’m all about iOS and Swift. (Once upon a time, I wrangled Windows Phone and .NET, but let’s not talk about that. 😉)

🔒 I’ve worked on privacy-first apps at [ProtonVPN](https://www.protonmail.com), and helped build secure corporate messaging at [Teamwire](https://www.teamwire.eu). I like making things that respect users and just work.

🎓 I have a master’s in Computer Science from Charles University in Prague, specializing in Software Engineering.

🧑‍💻 This blog is my programming journal: iOS, Swift, automation, and the occasional rant when tech misbehaves.

🖥 I’m a big fan of open source—check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/igorkulman) for projects, tools, and experiments. I’m also a contributor to [KeePassium](https://github.com/keepassium/KeePassium), a modern open-source password manager for Apple platforms.

🇸🇰 For my non-tech musings (in Slovak), visit [www.kulman.sk](https://www.kulman.sk).

☕ Always happy to chat about iOS, open source, or remote work—just reach out!
