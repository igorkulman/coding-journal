👋 Hi, I’m Igor!

📱 I’ve been building mobile apps for over a decade. These days I focus mainly on iOS and Swift. (Earlier in my career I worked with Windows Phone and .NET, but let’s not talk about that. 😉)

🔒 I’ve worked on privacy-first apps at [ProtonVPN](https://www.protonmail.com), and helped build secure corporate messaging at [Teamwire](https://www.teamwire.eu). Currently, I’m building an independent iOS app called [Yomu](https://yomuapp.kulman.sk), focused on helping Japanese learners read real text more comfortably. I like making things that respect users and just work.

🎓 I have a master’s degree in Computer Science from Charles University in Prague, with a specialization in Software Engineering.

🧑‍💻 This blog is my programming journal: iOS, Swift, automation, and the occasional rant when tech misbehaves.

🖥 I’m a big fan of open source—check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/igorkulman) for projects, tools, and experiments. I’m also a contributor to [KeePassium](https://github.com/keepassium/KeePassium), a modern open-source password manager for Apple platforms.

🎤 I occasionally give talks and lectures about mobile development, security, and software tooling. Some are recent, some older, but they reflect topics I’ve worked with long-term. You can find the full list on the [Talks](/talks) page.

🇸🇰 For my non-tech writing (in Slovak), visit [www.kulman.sk](https://www.kulman.sk).

☕ Always happy to chat about iOS, open source, or remote work—just reach out!
